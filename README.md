The lib is not needed for install. CMakeProject is using FetchContent to prepare lib for itself. (It steals some space, but guarantees the ability to run the program)


# How to run 

```
mkdir build
cd build 
cmake .. 
make  
```

And now on you only have to get to desired example to check the program.
